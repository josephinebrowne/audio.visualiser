This file contains the links to 2 final flowfield animations based on the concept of Perlin Noise synched to the volume of various songs 
one is in greyscale, and the other is in colour. I created these works using P5.js, a Java-based open source tool for creative coding.
P5.js functions as a small-scale, web-accessible version of the program Processing. 

In this file I have also contained a draft sketch created while completing The Coding Train's Perlin Noise Flowfield Video (2016), this 
animation shows vectors and particles being moved by the foce of said vectors.

Finally, I've attached a Colab file documenting my experimentation with audio analysis intalling a Librosa library, here I tracked the tempo 
of my chosen songs, synchronised pitch to the beats, and I also created some chromagraphs which similaryly synchronises pitch to beats, but 
in visual format.
